# gae_path.pth
# Fix path for Google App Engine modules
#
# Place in the virtualenv lib, not in the GAE lib.
# Only necessary if using a virtualenv that is using a different
# lib folder by default (e.g. where pip is putting stuff if you 
# don't specify a target dir with `-t`). In which case, copy
# this file to the default lib directory, and change the line below 
# to link to the Google App Engine lib directory. Verify that you
# have it set correctly by entering the python IDE while the virtualenv
# is activated, and try to import a package that you only have installed
# to the GAE lib and not to the virtualenv site-packages.
#
# In other words, if using virtualenv, with it activated, run
# python -c "import pip; print(pip.utils.site_packages)"
# and move this file to that directory, then change the line below
# to link back to this lib/
../../../{{cookiecutter.app_name}}/lib/
